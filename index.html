    <div class="smalltext width50">
        Still lifes invite a deeper reflection into the nature of the everyday. These quiet, introspective scenes transform the objects into symbols, imbued with meaning, turning the familiar into something profound. 

        In Sigua’s Modern Still Life, the desk’s stark simplicity in its arrangement and composition mirrors the modern trend of streamlined minimalism. 
        
        The piece is filled by cool red tones, dominated by neutrals outside of the objects themselves. This choice might reflect the emotional detachment or isolation that can accompany digital work environments. The pop of colours, however muted, found within the objects could symbolise the presence of life and vitality amidst the seriousness of the space.
        
        The artist could be showing the battle between the reliance on technology and the importance of self-care. The absence of clutter and the choice to focus on just a few items could suggest a desire to strip down to only the essentials: work, health, and basic needs- for better or for worse. Modern tools, such as the laptop stand and the mouse, creates with the analogue notebook and pencil. This could signify the need a lingering attachment to creating traditional art, as opposed to being constrained to the digital world in both professional and personal time. 
        
        In conclusion, this still life, though minimal, is rich with meaning. It offers a snapshot of modern student life that emphasises balance, health, and the streamlined efficiency of digital work.
